Morphologically, the malignant epithelial cells may display abnormal mitotic figures, anaplasia, and necrosis. Carcinomas are graded by the degree of cellular differentiation as well, moderately, or poorly differentiated. Carcinomas invade the surrounding tissues and tend to metastasize to other anatomic sites.

Myelomonocytic proliferation is seen in the bone marrow and the blood.  The leukemic cells may infiltrate any tissue, however liver, spleen, lymph nodes, skin, and respiratory tract are the most common sites of involvement. (WHO, 2001)",
            "A rare, highly aggressive, Epstein-Barr virus-associated leukemia, also known as aggressive NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma; it may represent the leukemic counterpart of nasal type extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas. It affects primarily teenagers and young adults. It is characterized by the systemic proliferation of NK cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver, and spleen.",
            "A chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an increased red blood cell production. The bone marrow is hypercellular due to a panmyelotic proliferation typically characterized by pleomorphic megakaryocytes. The major symptoms are related to hypertension, splenomegaly or to episodes of thrombosis and/or hemorrhage.",
            "A clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder, characterized by proliferation in the bone marrow of one or more of the myeloid (i.e., granulocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mast cell) lineages. It is primarily a neoplasm of adults. (WHO 2008)",

            "A rare myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a clonal proliferation of eosinophilic precursors resulting in persistently increased numbers of eosinophils in the blood, marrow and peripheral tissues.  Since acute eosinophilic leukemia is at best exceedingly rare, the term eosinophilic leukemia is normally used as a synonym for chronic eosinophilic leukemia.  In cases in which it is impossible to prove clonality and there is no increase in blast cells, the diagnosis of \"idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome\" is preferred.  (WHO, 2001)",
            "Hematologic neoplasms characterized by the rearrangement of the PDGFRA gene, most often resulting in the formation of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion transcripts. Patients usually present with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and less often with acute myeloid leukemia or T-lymphoblastic leukemia.",

            "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a polyclonal (benign) or clonal (malignant) proliferation of lymphoid cells that develops as a consequence of immunosuppression in a recipient of a solid organ or bone marrow allograft. PTLDs comprise a spectrum ranging from early, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven polyclonal lymphoid proliferations to EBV-positive or EBV- negative lymphomas of predominantly B-cell or less often T-cell type. (WHO, 2001)",
            "A clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder arising as a result of post-transplant immunosuppression therapy. It is characterized by destructive infiltration of lymph nodes and extranodal sites by a polymorphic B-cell infiltrate composed of small and medium sized lymphocytes, immunoblasts, and plasma cells. In some cases, reduction of the immunosuppression therapy may lead to regression of the lesions. In other cases the lesions may progress to lymphoma.",
            "This entity includes cases that have clinical, laboratory, and morphologic features that support the diagnosis of both a myelodysplastic syndrome and a myeloproliferative neoplasm, but do not meet the criteria for any of the other entities included in the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm category.  (WHO, 2001)",
            "A myelodysplastic syndrome characterized mainly by dysplasia of the erythroid series.  Refractory anemia is uncommon.  It is primarily a disease of older adults.  The median survival exceeds 5 years.  (WHO, 2001)",
            "A myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by an anemia in which 15% or more of the erythroid precursors are ring sideroblasts.

            "A myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by the presence of 5-19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow or 2-19% blasts in the peripheral blood. It includes two categories: myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-1 and myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-2.",
            "Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) is characterised by dysplastic features of the myeloid and usually erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and an increased number of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood.  The peripheral blood blast count ranges from 20% to 30%.  RAEB-T used to be a subcategory of myelodysplastic syndromes in the past.  Recently, the term has been eliminated from the WHO based classification of myelodysplastic syndromes.  The reason is that the percentage of peripheral blood blasts required for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia has been reduced to 20%.  The elimination of the RAEB-T term by the WHO experts has created confusion and ongoing arguments.  Currently, according to WHO classification, the vast majority of RAEB-T cases are best classified as acute leukemias (acute leukemias with multilineage dysplasia following myelodysplastic syndrome).  A minority of cases are part of RAEB-2.",
            "A myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by bi-cytopenia or pancytopenia and dysplastic changes in 10% or more of the cells in two or more of the myeloid cell lines. (WHO, 2001)",
            "A myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by a deletion between bands q31 and 33 on chromosome 5.  The number of blasts in the bone marrow and blood is <5%.  The bone marrow is usually hypercellular or normocellular with increased number of often hypolobated megakaryocytes.  The peripheral blood shows macrocytic anemia.  This syndrome occurs predominantly but not exclusively in middle age to older women.  The prognosis is good and transformation to acute leukemia is rare.  (WHO, 2001)",
            "A myelodysplastic syndrome caused by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.",
            "A clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in one or more of the hematopoietic cell lines. The dysplasia may be accompanied by an increase in myeloblasts, but the number is less than 20%, which, according to the WHO guidelines, is the requisite threshold for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. It may occur de novo or as a result of exposure to alkylating agents and/or radiotherapy. (WHO, 2001)",
            "A myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by the presence of at least 10% dysplastic neutrophils in the bone marrow or the peripheral blood.",

            "A carcinoma entirely confined to the mammary ducts.  It is also known as DCIS.  There is no evidence of invasion of the basement membrane.  Currently, it is classified into three categories: High-grade DCIS, intermediate-grade DCIS and low-grade DCIS. In this classification the DCIS grade is defined by a combination of nuclear grade, architectural growth pattern and presence of necrosis.  The size of the lesion as well as the grade and the clearance margins play a major role in dictating the most appropriate therapy for DCIS.",

The endocrine pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy. The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known.",
