         "A phosphoramidate derivative of the monophosphate form of cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine; 3'-dA), an adenosine derivative first isolated from Cordyceps sinensis, with potential antineoplastic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon administration and cellular uptake of NUC-7738 by passive diffusion, cordycepin monophosphate (3'-dAMP) is converted into its active anti-cancer metabolite 3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3'-dATP). 3'-dATP functions as a ribonucleoside analogue and competes with ATP during transcription. Therefore, this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, inhibits cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis. Also, 3'-dAMP activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. This prevents the hyperphosphorylation of the translation repressor protein 4E-BP1. This results in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation, and its expression or activity is frequently dysregulated in human cancers. Compared to cordycepin alone, the addition of the phosphoramidate moiety may overcome cancer resistance and allow for greater cytotoxicity as NUC-7738 does not require a nucleoside transporter for cellular uptake, is independent of  enzymatic activation by adenosine kinase (AK) and is not susceptible to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase (ADA). Altogether, this may help overcome cancer resistance to cordycepin.",

Upon intramuscular administration of the Ad5/F35-hGCC-PADRE, the Ad5/F35 targets CD46, which is expressed widely on most tumor cells, and the virus is taken up by cells. Once inside the cells, the virus expresses hGCC. The expressed hGCC induces both humoral and cellular immune responses against tumor cells expressing the hGCC antigen. This results in the immune-mediated killing of tumor cells. The hGCC protein is normally restricted to intestinal epithelial cells but is overexpressed by metastatic colorectal tumors. PADRE is a helper T-lymphocyte epitope that is able to augment the magnitude and duration of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response.

Upon administration, the anti-CD37 bispecific monoclonal antibody GEN3009 specifically targets and binds to two non-overlapping CD37 epitopes, thereby inducing an assembly of antibody hexamers through intermolecular Fc-Fc interactions at the cell surface of CD37-overexpressing tumor cells. These hexamers recruit and activate C1, the first component of complement, thereby triggering the complement cascade which activates the immune system to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In addition, GEN3009 binding to the CD37-overexpressing tumor cells also causes antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). CD37, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily of cell surface antigens, is expressed at high-levels on B cells and to a lesser extent on T cells and myeloid cells.

Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. By co-targeting CD47 and PD-1, HX009 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",

Upon administration, anti-PD1/CTLA4 bispecific antibody MEDI5752 targets and binds to both PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), and inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. In addition, MEDI5752 is internalized and is able to degrade PD-1. This restores immune function and activates a sustained cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD1 and CTLA4 with MEDI5752 may enhance T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone. It may also decrease toxicity by avoiding the binding to CTLA-4-expressing T-cells that are devoid of PD-1. The engineered Fc domain may reduce Fc effector function.",

         "A preparation of genetically modified T-lymphocytes transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) comprised of a CD28 co-stimulatory signaling domain fused to the zeta chain of the TCR/CD3 complex (CD3zeta), a truncated form of CD19 (CD19t), an immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-Fc (EQ) spacer, and a peptide derived from chlorotoxin (CLTX), with potential imaging and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, chlorotoxin (EQ)-CD28-CD3zeta-CD19t-expressing CAR T-lymphocytes are re-directed to specific tumor cells in the brain inducing selective toxicity in these tumor cells. CLTX, a 36-amino acid peptide found in the venom of the deathstalker scorpion (Leiurus quinquestriatus) and a chloride channel blocker, preferentially binds to glioma (and other neuroectodermal origin) cells via membrane bound forms of the endopeptidase matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). This may direct the T-lymphocytes to and induce selective toxicity in MMP-2-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, binding to MMP-2 on glioma cells may both interfere with transmembrane chloride exchange and inhibit proteolytic extracellular matrix remodeling by MMP-2, which may further limit the spread of these tumor cells. MMP-2 is specifically upregulated in gliomas and related cancers, but is not normally expressed in brain. The CD28 co-stimulatory molecule signaling domain enhances activation and signaling; its inclusion may increase proliferation of T-cells and antitumor activity compared to the inclusion of the CD3 zeta chain alone. IgG4-Fc (EQ) contains two point mutations in its spacer region which prevents recognition of the CAR by Fc receptors (FcRs) without altering the ability of the CAR to mediate antigen-specific lysis. CD19t, which lacks the cytoplasmic signaling tail, provides a non-immunogenic surface marker that allows for accurate measurement, efficient cell tracking and/or imaging of the therapeutic T-cells in vivo following adoptive transfer. Additionally, co-expression of CD19t functions as a \"suicide\" switch via clinically available antibodies or immunotoxins which can be used to selectively eliminate the genetically modified cells.",

Upon administration, BTX-A51 binds to and inhibits the activity of CK1alpha, CDK7, and CDK9. Blocking the phosphorylation and kinase activity of CK1alpha prevents the enhanced binding of murine double minute X (MDMX) to p53, the formation of CK1alpha and MDM2 complex, and the resulting inhibition of p53. This induces p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, slowing tumor cell proliferation. Blocking the phosphorylation and kinase activity of CDK7 and CDK9 prevents the positive transcription elongation factor b (PTEFb)-mediated activation of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and leads to the inhibition of gene transcription of various anti-apoptotic proteins. This also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, slowing tumor cell proliferation. CK1alpha, a serine/threonine kinase and a leukemic stem cell target, acts as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through the negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and p53. It negatively regulates p53 by phosphorylating MDMX, thus enhancing binding of MDMX to p53, as well as by forming a complex with MDM2. CDK7, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a role in controlling cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and promotes the expression of key oncogenes such as c-Myc through the phosphorylation of RNA Pol II. CDK9, also a serine/threonine kinase, regulates elongation of transcription through phosphorylation of RNA Pol II at serine 2 (p-Ser2-RNAPII).

Upon intratumoral administration of delolimogene mupadenorepvec, the virus infects and selectively replicates in tumor cells. This causes direct oncolysis and the release of a plethora of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells. The released TAAs stimulate the immune system and activate anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby further killing tumor cells. In addition, infected tumor cells and tumor stroma cells, including stellate cells and infiltrating immune cells, express the immunostimulants CD40L and 4-1BBL. The expressed CD40L and 4-1BBL proteins activate the CD40L- and 4-1BBL-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. This activates antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages. The DCs produce various cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL12), IL21, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), and interferon-gamma (IFNg), which leads to the activation and expansion of both T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Altogether, this modulates immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), disrupts tumor stroma, and causes additional immune stimulation against tumor cells, thereby inducing further tumor cell lysis. In addition, CD40L reduces myeloid suppressor cells in the TME. Inclusion of the chimeric Ad5/35 fiber targets CD46 and increases viral uptake in cells. Transgene expression is driven by a separate promoter to allow for efficient expression in both tumor cells and tumor stroma.

Upon oral administration, DNA-PK inhibitor AZD7648 selectively targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of DNA-PK, thereby interfering with the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) process and preventing repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity leading to enhanced tumor cell death. AZD7648 may also increase the effect of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and may work as a monotherapy in tumors with high endogenous levels of DNA damage resulting from defects in other DNA repair pathways. The enhanced ability of tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major role in the resistance of tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy. DNA-PK plays a key role in the NHEJ pathway and DSB repair.",
         "An orally bioavailable inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3-kinase subunit delta; PI3K-delta; PI3Kdelta) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities. Upon oral administration, the DNA-PK/PI3K-delta inhibitor BR101801 inhibits the activity of both PI3K-delta and DNA-PK. This prevents PI3K-mediated signaling pathways and may lead to the inhibition of cancer cell growth in PI3K-overexpressing tumor cells. Specifically, since PI3K regulates c-myc expression, inhibition of PI3K signaling may lead to a decrease in proliferation of c-myc-expressing tumor cells. Also, by inhibiting the activity of DNA-PK, this agent interferes with the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) process and prevents the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity by inhibiting the ability of tumor cells to repair damaged DNA. The PI3K pathway is upregulated in a variety of tumors and plays an important role in regulating cancer cell proliferation, growth, and survival. DNA-PK is activated upon DNA damage and plays a key role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks. The enhanced ability of tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major role in the resistance of tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy.

         "A heparin derivative in which the 2-O and 3-O sulfate groups of heparin are removed and that lacks anticoagulant activity, with potential anti-inflammatory, immodulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, dociparstat sodium binds to both chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). This prevents the interaction of CXCL12 with CXCR4, blocks CXCR4 activation, and may result in decreased proliferation and migration in CXCR4-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction may induce mobilization of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow into the blood.  In addition, dociparstat sodium prevents the interaction of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) with its ligands, including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), Mac-1(CD11b/CD18), the nuclear pro-inflammatory protein high mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB-1), carboxymethyl lysine-bovine serum albumin (CML-BSA) and members of the S100 calgranulin family. In addition, this agent inhibits the enzymes heparanase, cathepsin G, and human leukocyte elastase, which are involved in inflammation and metastasis. Altogether, this may inhibit tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis. Dociparstat sodium also binds to platelet factor 4 (PF4 or CXCL4) and may prevent PF4's inhibitory effect on platelet production. This may increase platelet production. Unlike heparin, this agent does not induce heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). RAGE, a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in inflammation and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family that plays an important role in chemotaxis, chemoresistance and angiogenesis, and is upregulated in several tumor cell types.

Upon oral administration of DTRM-555, the DTRMWXHS-12 component inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, and leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK. BTK plays an important role in the development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival of B-lymphocytes. The everolimus component binds to the immunophilin FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that binds to and inhibits the activation of mTOR, a key regulatory kinase.

Upon oral administration, metformin targets and inhibits complex I (NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and increases the cellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio leading to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This modulates AMPK-mediated transcription of target genes, which prevents hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, enhances insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation, and increases glucose uptake and utilization in target tissues. This lowers blood glucose levels. Metformin may exert antineoplastic effects through AMPK-mediated or AMPK-independent inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is up-regulated in many cancer tissues. It also reduces cyclin D1. This inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, this agent also inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression which is mediated through the suppression of transcription activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation.

Ilginatinib competes with ATP for binding to JAK2 as well as the mutated form JAK2V617F, thereby inhibiting the activation of JAK2 and downstream molecules in the JAK2/STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling pathway that plays an important role in normal development, particularly hematopoiesis. In addition, ilginatinib inhibits the Src family tyrosine kinases. This eventually leads to the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. JAK2 is the most common mutated gene in bcr-abl-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs); JAK2V617F is a constitutively activated kinase that activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and dysregulates cell growth and function, and its expression transforms hematopoietic cells to cytokine-independent growth.",

         "A dimeric fusion protein composed of the C-terminus of the domain antibody (dAb) BMS2h-572-633 targeting the CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154) linked to a modified Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), with potential immunomodulatory activity. Upon intravenous administration, the peptide moiety of letolizumab specifically targets and binds to CD40L expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents the binding of CD40L to its cognate receptor CD40 expressed on B-lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). This prevents T-cell mediated proliferation and differentiation of B-cells, and prevents the production of antibodies. By inhibiting both the production of anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antibodies by B-cells and GPIIb/IIIa-dependent T-cell proliferation, letolizumab may prevent platelet destruction and may increase platelet counts in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The direct binding of letolizumab to CD40L on platelets further prevents CD40L/CD40-mediated destruction by macrophages and DCs in ITP. The modified Fc domain prevents the binding of letolizumab to the Fc receptor FcgammaRIIA on platelets, thereby preventing FcgammaRIIA-dependent platelet activation and anti-CD40L-induced thromboembolism. CD40L, a transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, is primarily expressed on activated T-cells, but is also expressed on eosinophils, basophils, natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, platelets and activated endothelial cells.",

Oligo-fucoidan induces cell cycle arrest, activates caspases, induces apoptosis, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. It also increases the expression of tumor suppressors, such as p53, while decreasing levels of certain tumor promoters. Oligo-fucoidan also promotes the degradation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) receptor and the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It prevents tumor progression, alters tumor microenvironment (TME) and decreases the tumor-promoting M2 macrophages in the TME. Oligo-fucoidan has anti-inflammatory effects that suppress the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), and decrease the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (TNFa). This agent may also suppress angiogenic activity by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor expression and VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. As an antioxidant, this agent protects cells against oxidative stress by scavenging superoxide radicals and induces the expression of the anti-oxidant nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 and that of its target gene, superoxide dismutase; and prevents reactive oxidative species (ROS) generation in cancer cells and ROS release into the TME. Fucoidan also has immune-modulatory effects and enhances the proliferation of natural killer (NKs) cells and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs).",

Upon administration, light-emitting oncolytic vaccinia virus GL-ONC1 specifically enters tumor cells due to the permeable nature of the tumor vasculature. Once inside the cell, the virus replicates, resulting in tumor cell lysis and the release of mature viral particles into the tumor microenvironment. Released viral particles may then infect and destroy neighboring tumor cells. In addition, the release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by lysed tumor cells into the bloodstream may activate the immune system to mount a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor. The expression of RUC-GFP by this agent allows for both detection and monitoring of virally infected tumor cells in vivo and vitro with luciferase-mediated bioluminescence imaging and fluorescence imaging techniques.",

         "A replication competent, oncolytic adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) that has been modified with a delta24 (d24) deletion, an incorporation of an RGD-4C motif in the Ad fiber protein, and an insertion of the T1 mutation in E3/19K gene, with potential oncolytic activity. Upon administration, oncolytic adenovirus ORCA-010 binds to specific Ad3 receptors that are highly expressed on certain tumor cells. This results in the replication of oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/3-delta24 in tumor cells and induces tumor cell lysis which may potentially result in the activation of a systemic immune response against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). The Ad5/3-delta24 has a 24 base pair deletion in constant region 2 of the E1A gene which allows for selective replication in cells that are defective in the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A or p16INK4a). As most tumor cells are defective in the Rb/p16 pathway, this virus selectively replicates in these cells. The RGD-4C motif is a 9-amino acid peptide that binds to various and enhances viral-cell receptor binding by allowing for a Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent infection of tumor cells, which is the natural route of viral binding, as CAR expression is often deficient on cancer cells. As integrins are often overexpressed on tumor cell surfaces, integrin receptor binding enhances tumor cells binding and infection by the Ad. The T1 mutation enhances the Ad5 release from tumor cells and promotes spreading throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing anti-tumor activity. The T1 mutation, a single Adenine insertion at position 445 of the nucleotide sequence of the E3/19K gene of Adenovirus, creates a truncated E3/19K protein that is relocated to the plasma membrane due to the disruption of its ER retention signal. This increases plasma membrane permeability and enhances the release of Ad5.",
         "A recombinant, genetically modified, microRNA (miRNA)-attenuated oncolytic viral strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. In ONCR-177, a dual bidirectional promoter enables the expression of five different transgenes: the natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell activating cytokine interleuin-12 (IL-12), the chemokines C-C motif chemokine 4 (CCL4) and the extracellular domain of the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3LG), to allow for expansion and recruitment of classical dendritic cells (DCs), and antagonists to the immune checkpoints programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) to counter T cell exhaustion. Upon intra-tumoral administration, the oncolytic HSV-1 ONCR-177 specifically targets, infects and selectively replicates in tumor cells only while not infecting normal, healthy cells. This induces tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles then infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. The released tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells activate the immune system to exert an anti-tumor immune response against the tumor cells, thereby further killing the tumor cells. In addition, the expressed transgenes that are released upon tumor cell lysis induce a systemic tumor-specific immune response and activate NKs, DCs and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) while inhibiting regulatory T-cells (Tregs). This further kills nearby non-infected tumor cells. In ONCR-177, the neurovirulence gene ICP34.5 allows for potent oncolysis, even in the presence of host cell antiviral responses. To ensure selective replication and oncolysis in cancer cells while attenuating replication in healthy tissue, tissue specific miRNA-binding cassettes (miR-T) are inserted into early genes essential for viral replication.

Upon intratumoral administration, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. In addition, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 promotes the secretion of IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody by the tumor cells. IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor cells.

PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 consists of three monovalent antibody Fvs specific for PD-L1, HSA and 4-1BB fused in a single chain. Upon administration, PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 simultaneously targets and binds to a membrane-distal epitope of 4-1BB, which is expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. The simultaneous binding to PD-L1 enables clustering of 4-1BB and thereby allows for conditional stimulation of 4-1BB signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME) only upon binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells. 4-1BB activation results in T-cell stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity. At the same time, NM21-1480 prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth.

Upon oral administration, PRMT5 inhibitor PRT811 selectively binds to PRMT5 and inhibits its function. By inhibiting its methyltransferase activity, levels of both monomethylated and dimethylated arginine residues in histones H2A, H3 and H4 are decreased. This modulates the expression of genes involved in several cellular processes, including cellular proliferation. This may increase the expression of antiproliferative genes and/or decrease the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation, which may lead to decreased growth of rapidly proliferating cells, including cancer cells. PRMT5, a type II methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of both omega-N monomethylarginine (MMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA) on histones and a variety of other protein substrates involved in signal transduction and cellular transcription, is overexpressed in several neoplasms. Elevated levels are associated with decreased patient survival.",

Upon administration of racemetyrosine/methoxsalen/phenytoin/sirolimus SM-88, racemetyrosine, being a dysfunctional and modified form of the non-essential amino acid tyrosine, is specifically taken up by cancer cells through the transporter L-amino acid transferase-1 (LAT1; CD98). As a tyrosine derivative and faulty amino acid protein building block, racemetyrosine prevents protein synthesis in cancer cells. Specifically, this prevents mucin-1 (MUC1) protein synthesis. MUC1 is highly overexpressed by most cancer cells and regulates the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells created from the altered metabolism that cancer cells utilize, by upregulating key antioxidant defenses and preventing ROS-mediated apoptosis. In the absence of MUC1, ROS levels are increased, leading to an increase in oxidative stress, and induction of apoptosis. Also, being a protective transmembrane protein, MUC1 is part of the protective layer on the outside of cancer cells and plays a key role in shielding the cancer cell from the immune system. The loss of MUC1 compromises the cell membrane, thereby making the cancer cell more vulnerable to be recognized and attacked by the immune system. Rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, increases the cancer cells' need for tyrosine uptake and increases the uptake of racemetyrosine by LAT1. Phenytoin stimulates the release of reactive lipid species by the liver which accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are taken up by cancer cells, thereby further increasing ROS within the cancer cell and increasing oxidative-related apoptosis. Mehoxsalen promotes toxic electron transfer and increases melanin, increases oxidative reactions and production of ROS. This further stimulates oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Normal cells do not regularly take up certain non-essential amino acids, such as tyrosine, but readily convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, so normal healthy cells are not expected to consume racemetyrosine.",

Upon administration of trastuzumab-TLR 7/8 agonist BDC-1001, the trastuzumab moiety targets and binds to HER2 expressed on tumor cells and, simultaneously, the TLR 7/8 dual agonist moiety targets, binds to and activates TLR7/8 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), specifically dendritic cells (DCs), in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The trastuzumab binding to the tumor cells causes the engulfment of the BDC-1001-bound tumor cells by tumor-associated myeloid (TAM) cells and the TAMs travel to the lymph nodes. The DCs activated by the TLR7/8 agonist causes the activation of TLR7/8-mediated pathways, and stimulates the maturation and activation of DCs, thereby re-activating the immune system against the tumor cells. Activation of DCs results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)- and B-lymphocyte-mediated immune responses against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which lead to tumor cell lysis. TLR7 and 8, members of the TLR family, play fundamental roles in the activation of the innate immune system, myeloid cell responses and tumor antigen presentation.

Upon oral administration,  zorifertinib binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR as well as certain mutant forms of EGFR. This prevents EGFR-mediated signaling, and may lead to both induction of cell death and inhibition of tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",

         "A selective inhibitor of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of zotatifin, this agent targets and binds to elF4A, and promotes eIF4A binding to mRNA with specific polypurine motifs within their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), leading to the formation of a stable sequence-specific ternary complex with eIF4A and mRNA (elF4A- zotatifin-mRNA). This results in the translational repression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis, such as KRAS, Myc, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, cyclin D, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 and 2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2), and beta-catenin. The inhibition of the expression of these oncogenes leads to the inhibition of various oncogenic signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumor cells. eIF4A, a RNA helicase and the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex, catalyzes the ATP-dependent unwinding of RNA duplexes and facilitates 43S ribosome scanning within the 5'-UTR. elF4A is activated by various oncogenic signaling pathways, including RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, and regulates the translation of oncogenes and tumor survival factors with complex secondary structures within the 5'-UTRs that are required for tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis.",
         "An orally bioavailable citrate salt form of zotiraciclib a multi-kinase inhibitor for cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) subtypes 1, 2, 7 and 9, Janus-associated kinase 2 (JAK2), FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, FLK2, STK1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, CDK/JAK2/FLT3 Inhibitor TG02 binds to and inhibits the CDK subtypes, JAK2, and FLT3. TG02 also inhibits, to a lesser extent, TYK2, TYRO3, STAT5 and P38delta. This may result in both an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in cancer cells that overexpress these kinases. JAK2, often upregulated or mutated in a variety of cancer cells, mediates STAT3 activation and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. CDKs are serine/threonine kinases that play key roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and cellular proliferation. FLT3, a class III tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed or mutated in most B lineage and acute myeloid leukemias.",

During TCR engagement with MHC-associated antigen on host cell surfaces and synapse formation, CD3 activity leads to Tyr-phosphorylated CD3 subunits, Tyr phosphorylation of LAT colocalized in lipid rafts, and MAPK activation. CD3 signal transduction appears to involve LCK, ZAP70, Nck, SLA, SLA2, and DOCK2. CD3 subunits may also associate with the cytoskeleton. CD3 also mediates TCR signal transduction during the developmental transition through positive selection of immature thymocytes to mature CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. (NCI)",

         "A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm affecting the adrenal gland.",
         "The most frequently seen skin cancer. It arises from basal cells of the epidermis and pilosebaceous units. Clinically it is divided into the following types: nodular, ulcerative, superficial, multicentric, erythematous, and sclerosing or morphea-like. More than 95% of these carcinomas occur in patients over 40. They develop on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. Approximately 85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the trunk and extremities. Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent fashion. However, if untreated, the tumor may invade the subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle and bone. Distant metastases are rare. Excision, curettage and irradiation cure most basal cell carcinomas.",
         "A carcinoma arising from the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts.",
         "A carcinoma arising from the bladder epithelium. Approximately 90% of the bladder carcinomas are transitional cell carcinomas. The remainder are squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.",

Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation. The vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular). Breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route. The most common site of lymph node involvement is the axilla.",
         "A tumor composed of atypical neoplastic, often pleomorphic cells that invade other tissues. Malignant neoplasms often metastasize to distant anatomic sites and may recur after excision. The most common malignant neoplasms are carcinomas, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, leukemias, melanomas, and sarcomas.",

         "A neoplasm arising from hematopoietic cells found in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes and spleen (organs of the hematopoietic system). Hematopoietic cell neoplasms can also involve other anatomic sites (e.g. central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract), either by metastasis, direct tumor infiltration, or neoplastic transformation of extranodal lymphoid tissues. The commonest forms are the various types of leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and myelodysplastic syndromes.",
         "A malignant neoplasm characterized by a vascular proliferation which usually contains blunt endothelial cells. Erythrocyte extravasation and hemosiderin deposition are frequently present. The most frequent site of involvement is the skin; however it may also occur internally. It generally develops in people with compromised immune systems including those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).",
         "A carcinoma arising from the epithelium of the renal parenchyma or the renal pelvis. The majority are renal cell carcinomas. Kidney carcinomas usually affect middle aged and elderly adults. Hematuria, abdominal pain, and a palpable mass are common symptoms.",

         "A malignant (clonal) hematologic disorder, involving hematopoietic stem cells and characterized by the presence of primitive or atypical myeloid or lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and the blood. Leukemias are classified as acute or chronic based on the degree of cellular differentiation and the predominant cell type present. Leukemia is usually associated with anemia, fever, hemorrhagic episodes, and splenomegaly. Common leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment is vital to patient survival; untreated, the natural course of acute leukemias is normally measured in weeks or months, while that of chronic leukemias is more often measured in months or years.",
         "A carcinoma that arises from the hepatocytes or intrahepatic bile ducts. The main subtypes are hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma) and cholangiocarcinoma.",
         "A carcinoma originating in the lung. Lung carcinomas usually arise from the epithelium that lines the bronchial tree (bronchogenic carcinomas), and are classified as small cell or non-small cell carcinomas. Non-small cell lung carcinomas are usually adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, or large cell carcinomas. Metastatic carcinomas to the lung are also common, and can be difficult to distinguish from primary tumors.",
         "A primary or metastatic malignant tumor involving the lymph node. Lymphomas and metastatic carcinomas are representative examples.",
         "A malignant (clonal) proliferation of B- lymphocytes or T- lymphocytes which involves the lymph nodes, bone marrow and/or extranodal sites. This category includes Non-Hodgkin lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphomas.",

         "A usually aggressive malignant bone-forming mesenchymal neoplasm, predominantly affecting adolescents and young adults. It usually involves bones and less frequently extraosseous sites. It often involves the long bones (particularly distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus). Pain with or without a palpable mass is the most frequent clinical symptom. It may spread to other anatomic sites, particularly the lungs.",
         "A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the ovary. Most primary malignant ovarian neoplasms are either carcinomas (serous, mucinous, or endometrioid adenocarcinomas) or malignant germ cell tumors. Metastatic malignant neoplasms to the ovary include carcinomas, lymphomas, and melanomas.",
         "A carcinoma arising from the exocrine pancreas. The overwhelming majority of pancreatic carcinomas are adenocarcinomas.",

         "One of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men. The majority of carcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occur in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland. Grossly, prostatic carcinomas appear as ill-defined yellow areas of discoloration in the prostate gland lobes. Adenocarcinomas represent the overwhelming majority of prostatic carcinomas. Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic carcinoma. Treatment options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen ablation and cryotherapy. Watchful waiting or surveillance alone is an option for older patients with low-grade or low-stage disease.",

Carcinomas that arise from glandular epithelium are called adenocarcinomas, those that arise from squamous epithelium are called squamous cell carcinomas, and those that arise from transitional epithelium are called transitional cell carcinomas. Morphologically, the malignant epithelial cells may display abnormal mitotic figures, anaplasia, and necrosis. Carcinomas are graded by the degree of cellular differentiation as well, moderately, or poorly differentiated.

The hyperpigmented skin areas, are present from birth and found anywhere on the body surface.  They can vary markedly in size and color.  The dark brown areas are called cafe-au-lait spots. The multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors are nerve sheath tumors, called neurofibromas.  They can develop anywhere along the peripheral nerve fibers. Neurofibromas can become quite large, causing a major disfigurement, eroding bone, and compressing various peripheral nerve structures.  Type 1 neurofibromatosis has dominant inheritance, with a gene locus on the proximal long arm of chromosome 17.",

The endocrine pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy. The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known.",
